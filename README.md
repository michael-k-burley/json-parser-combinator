# json-parser-combinator

### This is a simple json parsing library 

#### Intention
I built this project in order to gain a better understanding of parsing and parser combinators.  
I was working through the book Functional Programming in Scala when I reached the chapter on parser combinators and was fascinated.

In writing this library, I learned a lot about parsing in general and about parser combinators in particular.  
I also learned more about the rust language. Specifically, concerning boxing, the sized trait and about dynamic dispatch.   

I included some sample JSON input files and the corresponding parsed output files for illustration.  
No doubt there are various improvements that could be made to this project.

#### How to Use
Program can be ran using rust's package manager, with cmd: cargo run
